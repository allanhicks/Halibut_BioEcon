# Halibut_BioEcon
### Biological simulation model for Pacific Halibut
***
### Purpose
To evaluate alternative strategies for mitigating biological, social and economic impacts of Pacific Halibut prohibited species catch in Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands groundfish fisheries.
In order to simulate the biological component of this analysis a sex and age-structured population dynamics model has been constructed, based on available information on demographic parameters and fishery selectivity from various [International Pacific Halibut Commission](http://www.iphc.washington.edu/) reports.
